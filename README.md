# AWS CloudFormation Reference

The intention of this project is to create CloudFormation templates that can get the ball rolling. Whether you are learning about AWS or just need a template to quickly reference, I want this to be your first stop. I keep coming back to these templates as a starting point, and anytime I create new infrastructure, I try to make it into a generic starting point for this project.

There are tons of services offered by AWS and it can be confusing to know which integrations work the best or how to even start using them. I have strong opinions about most AWS services that my experience plays into. I want this project to hold my opinionated view on how to build infrastructure on AWS.
