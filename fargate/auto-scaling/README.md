## Auto Scaling Fargate Service

The auto scaling Fargate service is based on the [serverless container API template](./basic/serverless-container-api.yml) but modified to include auto scaling capability. The CloudWatch alarm that is in this template is not the best example of what this is best used for although it is one application. CPU or memory utilization might be better, or maybe looking at another upstream process's load is best. The decision of what to scale off of should be workload dependent in my opinion. I simply wanted to give a brief and simple working example to show what auto scaling looks like for a Fargate service. Please take this template and tailor it to your needs.
